 <p><b>What is Vocational Education ?</b>
 <ol>Vocational education is education that prepares people to work as a technician or to take up employment in a skilled craft
 or trade like tradesperson or artisan. Vocational education is sometimes referred to as career and technical education.
 A vocational school is a type of educational institution specifically designed to provide vocational education.</ol>
 <ol>Historically, almost all vocational education took place in the classroom or on the job site, with students learning
 trade skills and trade theory from accredited instructors or established professionals. However, in recent years, online
 vocational education has grown in popularity, making learning various trade skills and soft skills from established
 professionals easier than ever for students, even those who may live far away from a traditional vocational school.</ol>
